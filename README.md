# READ ME PLEASE! IT TOOK ME TIME!

## Hi there!

I won't ask how you got here in the first place because randomly people get interested to see what it is and they come check it out. If you have heard of the game **Minecraft** then you probably know what Bukkit / Spigot is. I'm what people call us "a Bukkit / Spigot plugin developer". Personally this is a plugin for me not for anyone else since I didn't plan on releasing this.

## What is this plugin for?

This plugin was originally developed for the player to be a factory owner and make their humongous fully automated factory that you can change around as much as you like and buy as many equipment as you need. *(This plugin / game is more designed for people who like strategizing and creating big things that can take time to create)* Yet if you want to get this plugin, you will have to wait until that it is playable and there will be a link to the bukkit/spigot page for the plugin when available.

## Bukkit / Spigot Link (in development, no link currently)

Will probably add a link before releasing jar, testing bugs and other things will happen before. Information indepth commands and such will be there.

## A list of commands (without descriptions due to this is a GitHub page and not a Bukkit / Spigot page)

*/fhelp [page/command]*, */fbuyslot <factory #>*, */fbuyfactory*, */fbuyequipment*, */fstats [player]*, */fhome*. **_More will be added later due to other updates_** 

## Have any suggestions?

Make a pull request and I'll see if I can get back to them as soon as possible!

## Thank you for reading the READ ME!
